# Spotify Higher or Lower Game!

## Lessons Learned from this Project?
This was my first Vite/ReactJS with TailwindCSS full project, from this I learned how to use checks after pulling a Random Value from the Array given! 
<br />
On top of the Array value checks I learned about how to use hover transitions and durations with TailwindCSS, I really enjoyed that learning process and was really easy to get down!
